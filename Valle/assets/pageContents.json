Sonata for Cello and Piano in C major, op. 119 <br><br>You will hear the 20th century masterpieces of the cello repertoire – the sonatas for cello and piano by Rachmaninoff, Shostakovich, and Prokofiev. Although in this genre, these Russian classics composed only one piece each, every sonata brings out the intense melodiousness and the virtuous abilities of the cello, and gives a great style example of the works of the composers. In the Russian cello sonatas, romantic passion, elegiac poetry, and intense storytelling will be connected to form an unforgettable unity."
